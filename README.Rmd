```

## Usage

Load the package and run the shiny application by typing:

```R
library(rdcq)
dcqUI()
```

## Acknowledgement

The purpose of this package is to implement several published methods for the quantification of cell abundances, as well to provide a platform for developing variants of these methods. Currently implements the following published methods:

* Digital Cell Quantification (DCQ), available at [http://dcq.tau.ac.il](http://dcq.tau.ac.il) and in the R package [ComICS](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ComICS).
